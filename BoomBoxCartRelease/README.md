# BoomboxCartUpgrade 

Adds a "Boombox" component into the cart with its own UI that plays video links as audio from the cart. 
Has volume and quality sliders as well to configure the music to your liking. One player can control the 
Boombox UI at any time, and everyone (with the mod installed) can hear the songs you play too!

Current websites you can play audio from:
 - Youtube (Music)
 - SoundCloud
 - Rutube
 - music.yandex
 - Bilibili

Reach out to me (link at the end) for issues with any service listed here, or suggestions on adding new ones from <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md">these sites</a>

## Usage

<p>Not everyone in the lobby needs the mod, they just won't hear it otherwise.</p>
<p>Incompatible with the original BoomBox mod. May cause crashes.</p>

<p>How to use mod:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Grab on to a cart</li>
    <li>Press 'Y' on your keyboard (note: 'Y' is the default key - can be changed. Only one person can have the UI open at a time)</li>
    <li>Paste in a video link for the music/video you want to play</li>
    <li>Press 'Play', wait a moment for the video to download (longer videos may take longer), and audio should start playing!</li>
</ol>
<p>Known Issues:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When the menu is opened you can still move and click through it</li>
    <li>Singleplayer does NOT work at all. Clicking "Host Game" and playing solo works though!</li>
    <li>Small stutter when audio is downloaded (longer video, longer stutter)</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible Future Features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Suggest some maybe!</li>
</ul>

## Credits
<p>A HUGE thanks to @survivalq and their <a href="https://github.com/survivalq/SemiBoombox">SemiBoombox Mod</a> for critical funcionality for parts of this mod. If you're looking to make your own boombox mod or just play audio from a third-party, check their mod out, it is much better code!!!
